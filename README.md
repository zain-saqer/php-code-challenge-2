# Coding challenge - Statistics APIs
Please use PHP 7.4 or 8.0, Symfony 5, Doctrine and an RDBMS of your choice to create one service which provides a REST API endpoint as explained below.
 
# Todo
- Create these two tables (and respective Doctrine entities): 
    1) `hotel`(`id`, `name`)
    2) `review`(`id`, `hotel_id`, `score`, `comment`, `created_date`)
- Fill the `hotel` table with 10 rows with random names
- Fill the `review` table with a total number of 100.000 reviews which are distributed randomly over the last two years. Score and comments should be randomly filled and each hotel should have a random number of reviews as well.
- ### Overtime Endpoint:
  It gets a hotel-id and a date range from http requests and returns the overtime average score of the hotel for grouped date ranges. The date range is grouped as follows:
  - 1 - 29 days: Grouped daily
  - 30 - 89 days: Grouped weekly
  - More than 89 days: Grouped monthly
  
  The response should contain "review-count", "average-score" and "date-group" (either the day, calendar-week or the month) per data point.
- Use a DTO layer and a serializer to generate the response for the endpoint.
- Use Doctrine QueryBuilder for fetching the data.
- Test the application by functional or unit tests using PHPUnit.
- Note that it is a minimal amount of data to work with, the implementation should ideally work with larger amount of hotels and reviews.
- You do not need to dockerize the application. 
- Upload the project on github, gitlab or bitbucket and send it to us. You can use a temporary or throwaway account to maintain privacy.

Happy coding!
